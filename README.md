# Front-End Netflix with API. 
This project aimed to create a clone of the globally known streaming application Netflix. Using React and querying TheMovieDatabase API, the application stays true to details like animations and responsiveness.

Project built along with the video/course from B7Web. All credits to Bonieky. https://youtu.be/tBweoUiMsDg
